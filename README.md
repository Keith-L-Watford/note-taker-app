## Description
I decided to test my skills in express.js and build my first server and sudo-database using a .json file. Using a prepackaged front end note taking application, I was able to set up a server.js and mostly connect it. There are still some bugs. I cant view the added notes. However, I can still save and delete notes if I refresh the page after clicking the button. I can see the added notes in the db.json file.

## Installation
npm i

## Usage
After installing the required nodes, open the server.js in the terminal/gitbash of your choice. Then input 'node server.js' followed by enter to start the application. <br>

## Notes
It still kind of blows my mind that a basic server can be created with only 4 lines of code. Im going to have to come back to this and do more research on how to properly connect the front-end to the back-end. 

## Credits
Thanks to Shane for giving me a helpful line of code.
